# Core FastAPI and ASGI server
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]

# Database ORM
sqlalchemy

# JWT handling
python-jose[cryptography] # For jwt.encode, jwt.decode

# Password Hashing
passlib[bcrypt]           # For generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
werkzeug                  # Often a dependency for passlib, good to include

# Pydantic (Data validation and settings for FastAPI)
pydantic[email]           # Includes EmailStr and other email validation

# Environment variable management
python-dotenv             # For load_dotenv()

# Twilio (for video call token generation)
twilio

# Alembic (if you are still using it for migrations, which is recommended)
alembic

# Database Driver (CHOOSE ONE based on your production database)
# psycopg2-binary           # For PostgreSQL
# mysqlclient               # For MySQL
# pyodbc                    # For SQL Server (often with specific ODBC drivers)
# If you only ever plan to use SQLite (even for local dev and testing on Vercel's ephemeral storage),
# no specific driver is typically needed here beyond SQLAlchemy itself. But for a real deployment
# with persistent data, you'd uncomment one of the above or add the relevant driver.
